        <h2>The Dream of Chinatown</h2>
        <p>If you think Chinatown is only a place for restaurants and delicious food, there is much more you have to learn in order to fully understand this cultural community.
		 Chinatown, Chicago, a small neighborhood located between Bridgeport and South Loop, is the starting place for most of the Chinese immigrants.
		 For most of the Chinese immigrants, Chinatown is the very beginning of their life in America.
		 They work just as hard as people in other neighborhoods, but their desire for a better future is what others lack.
		 In this small but marvelous community, ordinary people are creating extraordinary stories one after another.
		 </p>
		 <br>
        <p>Many of you might have heard the story about J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, chasing her dream of becoming a writer.
		On the path towards her dream, she was in such a financial crisis that she could not even afford a computer, thus she had to type out every chapter of her books to send to publishers.
		Many publishers once rejected her books; however, because of her perseverance, she was able to find a publisher that was willing to appreciate her work and allow her to finally publish.
		Similar to J.K. Rowling, the main character of this story is a Chinese immigrant who is chasing his dream with his perseverance in Chicago Chinatown.
		</p><br>
        <p>Chinatown, Chicago is a place filled with infinite possibilities for Chinese immigrants. 
		For example, some people are able to manage to break through the unseen gap of Chinatown and the outside world, but some have to stay in Chinatown for most of their life by working and hoping for a better life.
		Seven years ago, a family from China deplaned in O'hare Airport of Chicago. 
		Same as most families, this family had three members: a hardworking father, a kind mother, and a fifth grade son.
		When this family first arrived in the city of Chicago, with the help of relatives, they were able to find a basement in Chinatown to be their first home.
		</p><br>
        <p>Because of the language barrier, the parents had to work in Chinese restaurants in Chinatown for long hours and low pay, and their son had to go to a neighborhood school for bilingual education. 
		The son always had a dream since he was a child, which was to become an inventor like The Wright Brothers. Because of his engaged and playful attitude, he did not have a hard time making friends in school. 
		Furthermore, his first bilingual teacher was very enthusiastic when helping him with school work and teaching him proper English.
		However, good times never last long. Two years later, the boy became a seventh grader in the same school; everything seemed to be the same, but he had to say goodbye to his favorite teacher. 
		In his last two years of elementary school, he had a teacher who disagreed with him at everything, it did not matter whether the son was correct or not.
		</p><br>
        <p>One day, the teacher asked the class to write a paper about their dreams and the boy wrote; he expressed his love for innovations and technology, even suggesting his hope to become a positive influence to the other inventors of the world. 
		However, when the teacher read his paper, the teacher did not give a fair grade to him because the teacher disagreed with his dream. 
		Of course, the son was not convinced that he deserved the grade he got, so he asked another teacher to read his paper. 
		When he heard that his paper did not deserve the grade his teacher gave to him, he found himself angry at all the unfairness in society.
		</p><br>
        <p>When he was ready to give up his dream, he realized that the reason for the Chinese immigrants to persevere and work hard: they wish to achieve their dreams and strive for a better future. 
		After his enlightenment, he began to study hard for his dream and despite the hardships he encountered, he never gave up. 
		Later in the year, he was able to attend one of top high schools in Chicago. 
		Fast forward four years, the son is ready to graduate from high school. 
		Throughout his high school career, he never stopped working towards his dream because he understands the cruel reality of the Chinatown community: if one is willing to work hard and have perseverance for his dream, he will be able to become successful.
		On the other hand, if one gives up easily, he would be looked down by others in the neighborhood and can never escape this community.</p>

		<h2>中国城梦</h2>
        <br>
		<p>可能你觉得唐人街只是一个吃饭的地方，但其实有很多别的东西你需要学校去理解这个文化社区。芝加哥唐人街位于Bridgeport和South Loop之间，对于大多数中国移民来说，唐人街是他们在美国生活的起点。他们与其他社区的人一样努力工作，但他们美好未来的渴望是其他人没有的。在这个小而精悍的社区中，人们一个接一个地创造非凡的故事。
		</p><br>
		<p>你们许多人可能听说过关于哈利波特系列作者J. K. Rowling追逐她成为作家的梦想的故事。在她的梦想之路上，她有严重的财政困难，甚至连电脑都买不起，因此她不得不将自己的每一章都打出来发给出版商。许多出版商曾拒绝她的书籍，然而由于她的坚持不懈，她找到了一位愿意欣赏她的作品并允许她最终出版的出版商。类似于J.K.罗琳，这个故事的主角是一位中国移民，他在芝加哥唐人追逐自己的梦想。
		</p><br>
		<p>芝加哥唐人街对于中国移民来说是一个充满无限可能的地方。有些人成功打破唐人街和外部世界隐形的差距，但有些人却不得不呆在唐人街工作，希望过上更美好的生活。七年前，一个来自中国的家庭在芝加哥的奥黑尔机场着陆。与大多数家庭一样，这个家庭有三名成员：一位勤奋的父亲，一位善良的母亲和五年级的儿子。当这个家庭第一次到达芝加哥市时，在亲戚的帮助下，他们在唐人街的地下室找到他们的第一个家。
		</p><br>
		<p>由于语言障碍，父母不得不在唐人街的中餐馆里长时间工作而工资却很低，他们的儿子不得不去附近的学校接受双语教育。儿子从小就有一个梦想，那就是成为像莱特兄弟一样的发明家。由于他的积极和顽皮的态度，他在学校里并没有很难交到朋友。此外，他的第一个双语老师热情地帮助他完成学业和教他正确的英语。然而，好时光没有持续很久。两年后，这个男孩成为了同一所学校的七年级学生；一切似乎都是一样的，但他不得不向他最喜欢的老师说再见。在他小学的最后两年里，他有一个老师，他在任何事情上都不同意他的观点，他的儿子是否正确并不重要。
		</p><br>
		<p>有一天，老师让全班写一篇关于他们梦想的文章，这个男孩写道：他表达了他对创新和技术的热爱，甚至表示他希望能够对世界其他发明家产生积极的影响。然而，当老师读他的文章时，老师并没有给他一个合理的评分，因为老师不同意他的梦想。当然，儿子不相信他应得的成绩，所以他请另一位老师阅读他的论文。当他听说他的论文不值得他的老师给他的评分时，他发现自己对社会上的不公平感到愤怒。
		</p><br>
		<p>当他准备放弃梦想时，他意识到他当初移民的原因：他们希望实现自己的梦想，为更美好的未来而努力。在这次觉醒之后，他开始努力学习他的梦想，尽管遇到了很多困难，但他从未放弃。今年晚些时候，他成功被芝加哥的一所顶尖高中录取。四年很快过去了，他马上要从高中毕业了。在高中上学期间，他也从未停止对梦想的工作，因为他了解唐人街社区的残酷现实：如果一个人愿意努力工作并为他的梦想持之以恒，他将能够成功。另一方面，如果一个人容易放弃，他会被附近的其他人看低，永远不能逃脱这个社区。
